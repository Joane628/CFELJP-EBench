# CFELJP-EBench
We construct an explainable evaluation benchmark Conceptual Forest(A total of 4,062 items) for the aggravated assault and the picking quarrels and provoking trouble, which mainly includes four aspects: crime constitution, circumstance for sentencing, criminal pattern and sentence. The CFELJP-EBench can be used to evaluate the interpretability of the LJP outputs of the large language models hierarchically and comprehensively. We have shown 4062 annotated data, 2814 annotated data for aggravated assault, and 1221 annotated data for picking quarrels and provoking trouble.
